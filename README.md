"# BallClick-JS" 

Date: March 28, 2024

Currently, trying to complete the ballclick website. Mostly a css problem. It is currently 12:11 am and there a economics test tmr. Great Job Aman. Why are you doing this to yourself? Anyway, I have to start studying for the test.

I will complete the tic-tac-toe css, and hopefully create Minesweeper in JS.

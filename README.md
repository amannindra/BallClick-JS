## Update History

Currently, trying to complete the BallClick website. It's mostly a CSS problem. There's an economics test tomorrow. Great job, Aman. Why are you doing this to yourself? Anyway, I have to start studying for the test.

Plans for next updates:
- I will complete the Tic-Tac-Toe CSS.
- Hopefully, create Minesweeper in JS.

I updated the README file. Additionally, I finished the Timer and Count JS. This website is done. By the way, I did complete the Tic-Tac-Toe game. Maybe not the CSS, though since CSS is difficult.
